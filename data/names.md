## List of Christian names 

| Name | Meaning | Origin | Pronunciation | Detail |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| Noah | peaceful | Hebrew | \noah\ | It’s no wonder Noah has had a meteoric rise among biblical names. A top 15 pick for boys since 2009, Noah’s ascent has been nothing short of miraculous. In the Bible, Noah survived the Great Flood by building an ark. That’s the kind of resourcefulness and steadfastness that parents pay attention to—and may wish to bestow on their own sons. If you’re looking for a name that’s built to endure storms and weather disasters, this is the one. |
| Ava | life" or "serpent", or from Latin "avis" meaning "bird | Hebrew | \a-va\ | Ava possesses the vintage Hollywood glam of screen siren Ava Gardner, plus the sleek appeal and allure of compact, modern-sounding names that speed along the popularity lists (like Mia). Ava is one of those elemental names at home in many countries, like Iran (it means “voice” in Persian). In Hebrew it’s seen as related to Chava, which means “life” or “serpent,” or could be descended from the Latin Avis, meaning “bird.” High-profile parents who’ve picked Ava include Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Jackman, Eli Manning, Mia Hamm and Jeremy Renner. |
| Elijah | the Lord is my God | Hebrew | \e-li-jah\ | Among Biblical names, Elijah strikes a balance between the vowel-packed endings of old-school names like Jeremiah and Josiah with more common names like David and Daniel. The name is experiencing a surge of popularity. In the Bible, Elijah was one of the great prophets who performed miracles and spoke out against false prophets and idols. His last miracle was ascending to heaven in a whirlwind, riding in a chariot. We predict Elijah will keep rising in the rankings. Heather Morris had her first son Elijah in 2013. |
| James | he who supplants | Hebrew | \j(a)-mes\ | This popular, traditional name has been found in the Bible, among British royalty and in the White House. No fewer than six US presidents—and six Scottish kings—have been named James. Its pop-culture cool is a direct descendant of James Bond and James Dean. It’s also in vogue as a fashionably trendy middle name for girls, less frequently as a first name. That didn’t stop Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively from naming their eldest daughter James. Non-English takes are fresh and plentiful, from the Irish Seamus and the French Jacques to the Italian Giacomo and the Scottish Hamish. |
| Benjamin | son of the right hand; son of the south; son of my old age | Hebrew | \b(e)-nja-min, ben-jamin\ | Imagine trying to come up with 12 different boys’ names for your sons. In the Bible, Benjamin was the youngest and most beloved son of Jacob and Rachel. Benjamin may not seem like the most electrifying choice, but today the name is very popular. If you need more proof that Big Ben is back in a major way, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen named their second son Benjamin in 2009, followed by John Travolta and Kelly Preston a year later. |
| Isabella | God's promise | Hebrew | \i-sa-bella, isab(el)-la\ | A royal name, Isabella is feminine and romantic. It’s the Italian and Spanish version of Elizabeth that originated during the Middle Ages. As Elizabeth made its way through Spain, Italy and Provence, France, it became Isabeth, then Isabeau and Isabel, before morphing into Isabella and Isabelle. Isabella reached England in the 13th century and was considered interchangeable with Elizabeth for generations. Nicknames such as Isa, Bella and Izzy have added to its appeal, landing it in the top 10 and top 3. Twilight fans will remember Isabella (or Bella) Swan. |
| Michael | who resembles God? | Hebrew | \m(i)-chael\ | Emperors, kings and saints have borne the name Michael over the centuries. From 1954 to 2008, Michael enjoyed a spectacular streak of popularity, mostly coming in first but sometimes sliding into second. It’s a superhero name in the Bible, belonging to the archangel Michael, the leader of heaven’s armies whose powerful protection is invoked in prayers for soldiers, police officers and firefighters. Occasionally, Michael has been pressed into service as a girls' name too. |
| Ethan | firmness, long-lived | Hebrew | \e-than\ | Ethan is a biblical name and a traditional pick for families that’s enduring, sturdy and sensitive. It’s also the name of a Revolutionary War hero (and a furniture franchise), Ethan Allen. It remains a distinctive choice today. Along with actor Ethan Hawke and director Ethan Coen, you'll find pop-culture namesakes in Ethan Hunt from the Mission: Impossible movies and the titular character of Edith Wharton’s novel Ethan Frome. |
| Daniel | God is my judge | Hebrew | \d(a)-niel\ | Daniel remains one of the most fascinating figures in the Bible and one of the most enduring boys' names, no matter if you are in the US, Ireland or Spain. Known for interpreting dreams and visions, Daniel survives being thrown into the lion's den by his enemies and emerges to become one of the Bible's great prophets. Since 1952, the name has regularly shown up in the Social Security Administration's top 10 or top 20 boys' names. Solange Knowles named her son Daniel after his father in 2004 but calls him by his middle name, Julez. |
| Jacob | he who supplants | Hebrew | \j(a)-cob\ | Jacob heralded the return of biblical names to the forefront. It was a juggernaut for 14 years as the most popular boys' name in the country from 1999 to 2012, according to the Social Security Administration. A beloved werewolf character in Twilight helped catapult the name as well. Parents love the name Jacob, and it’s easy to see why. It not only comes with an easy and appealing nickname, Jake, but is steeped in tradition as well. |
| Levi | joined | Hebrew | \l(e)-vi\ | Levi is a biblical name that has become popular again. The son of Jacob and Leah, Levi is a prophet whose tribe’s descendants include Moses and Aaron. In the New Testament, Levi is the original name of the apostle Matthew. Like denim manufacturer Levi Strauss, whose company produced the first blue jeans in 1873, this name is made of a sturdy cloth. Underground Railroad leader Levi Coffin is another historical namesake. Celebrity parents include Sheryl Crow and Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves. |
| Mateo | gift of God | Hebrew | \m(a)-teo\ | Mateo is the Spanish form of Matthew, a biblical name, a saint’s name and the name of one of the 12 apostles in the New Testament. Before Matthew became an apostle (and the patron saint of bankers and accountants), he was called Levi. Mateo comes with the stylish nickname Teo and the variations Matteo, Matias and Matthias. Mateo has made a dramatic climb in popularity since 1992, and though slowing down, it shows no signs of stopping. International soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo named one of his twins Mateo in 2017. |
| Samuel | God heard | Hebrew | \s(a)-muel\ | An enduring and beloved name, Samuel has spent many years in the top 30. In the Bible, Samuel was the last of the Hebrew judges and the first prophet of Israel, who anointed the first two kings: Saul and David. From founding father Samuel Adams to Irish playwright Samuel Beckett and English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, many Samuels have a way with words. Celebrity parents who have chosen Samuel for their own sons include Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck, Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, and comedian Jack Black. |
| Joseph | Jehovah increases | Hebrew | \j(o)-se-ph\ | Joseph has a rich history beginning with the Hebrew Bible. Christians will recognize the name for Joseph (husband to Mary, the mother of Jesus) and Joseph of Arimathea (the man who helped bury and entomb Jesus). Enjoying great popularity in the English-speaking world, the name has countless variations in other cultures and their languages. History has shown that even your average Joes can grow up to be strong, dedicated leaders–just look at former Vice President Joe Biden and Nez Perce's Chief Joseph! |
| John | God is gracious | Hebrew | \jo-hn\ | This biblical name has been borne by a multitude of saints and at least 23 popes. Kings of Hungary, Portugal, France and Poland and eight Byzantine emperors have been named John, making it a royal name as well. It was the most popular name for boys from 1880 to 1923 and remained in the top 10 until 1972, according to Social Security Administration data. Parents have also opted for less common variants, including Jonathan and Jack. |
| David | beloved | Hebrew | \d(a)-vid\ | David held the top spot in the country for just one year, 1960, but has remained a steady and constant presence in the top 20 for decades. It is both a biblical name and a royal name, thanks to King David, who as a boy defeated the giant Goliath with his slingshot. The young shepherd also happened to be a poet, a musician who played the lyre, a soldier, a statesman and a prophet. David is a name that belongs to no single country or religion. Two medieval kings of Scotland and the patron saint of Wales also bear the name. |
| Matthew | gift of God | Hebrew | \m(a)-tthew\ | Matthew is truly a classic and beloved boys' name and was in the top 10 from 1972 to 2008. It is a biblical name, a saint’s name and the name of one of the 12 apostles. Before Matthew became an apostle (and the patron saint of bankers and accountants), he was known as Levi. It’s no surprise that actor Matthew McConaughey named his firstborn son Levi in 2008. Today Matthew remains solidly in the top 20, with parents also finding Mateo, Matteo, Matias and Matthias appealing. |
| Abigail | father of exaltation | Hebrew | \a-bi-gail\ | Abigail was King David's wife in the Bible, and as a girls' name, it has come to represent wisdom. Two Abigails who made their mark on American history were Abigail Adams, the intelligent and resourceful wife of John Adams, and Abigail Williams, one of the primary accusers in the Salem witch trials. (She can also be found in Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible.) Former child actress and working actor Abigail Breslin helped popularize the name in the 2000s. The name is especially popular for fictional characters in both drama and children’s fiction. |
| Asher | happy | Hebrew | \a-sher\ | The Puritans were among the first to dust off this biblical name and introduce it to the English-speaking world. The happy meaning, the soft falling sound of Ash at the beginning and the trendy –er at the finish have helped propel the gentlemanly Asher to become a more approachable choice. In the Bible, Asher was the eighth son of Jacob and promised a life of blessings and abundance. Today, Asher is more popular than ever, propelling its way to the top 100 and beyond. |
| Jayden | thankful or God will judge | Hebrew | \ja(y)-den\ | There are many ways to spell this name, but the inventive Jayden has always been the most popular, followed by Jaden and Jaiden. To date, Jayden is the only nontraditional boys' name to enter the top 5 in a crowd that includes soundalike names Brayden and Kaden. It was at the height of its popularity from 2003 to 2013, thanks to celebrity parents. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett kicked off the trend with son Jaden in 1998, followed by Christian Slater, David Boreanaz and Andre Agassi. But for Britney Spears, it was all about the Ys: she named her second son Jayden Jaymes in 2006. |
| Elizabeth | God's promise or God is my oath | Hebrew | \e-lizabe-th, el(i)-za-beth\ | Elizabeth is descended from the Hebrew name Elisheva, which then became Elisabeth. In the Bible, Elizabeth is the mother of John the Baptist. This royal name became popular in England with Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603), whose reign lasted 44 years. The daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth I was named after her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Elizabeth Howard. Today parents are much more likely to use Elizabeth as a middle name, shorten it to Eliza for a first name or be inspired by the Scottish Elspeth, the French Lisette and the Spanish Isabel. Place name: Elizabeth is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and Elizabeth City is located in North Carolina. |
| Ezra | helper | Hebrew | \e-zra, ez-ra\ | Ezra is a biblical name that’s poetic and heroic. Favored by the Puritans in the 17th century, it offers an unusual combination of vowels and consonants within striking distance. Ezra stands out as a distinctive name among epic Old Testament names. In the Bible, Ezra was a priest and a scribe who recorded the departure of the Israelites from slavery in Babylon. He also led a group of slaves to freedom in Jerusalem. |
| Isaac | laughter | Hebrew | \i-saac\ | In the Old Testament, Isaac is the miracle baby of 100-year-old Abraham and 90-year-old Sarah. Variations of this biblical name include Issac, Izak, Yitzhak and the nickname Ike. Currently Isaac is at the height of its popularity, ahead of Isaiah. Famous namesakes include British scientist Sir Isaac Newton, Nobel Prize–winning novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer and “Soul Man” singer and actor Isaac Hayes. |
| Aria | lioness | Hebrew | \a-ria\ | In Hebrew this name means “lioness,” but it is also a musical term derived from an 18th-century Italian word meaning “air” or "tune." An aria is an expressive melody sung by a single voice, usually in an opera. Either way, Aria hits all the right notes with parents. The TV exposure hasn’t hurt either, as viewers have watched the quirky and beautiful Aria Montgomery on Pretty Little Liars and the fearless and avenging Aryah Stark on Game of Thrones. |
| Josiah | Jehovah helps | Hebrew | \j(o)-siah\ | Over the past few decades, Josiah has risen steadily in the Social Security Administration rankings, entering the top 100 in 2008. In the Bible, Josiah was the son of King Amon and only 8 years old when he began to rule Judah. Known for his piety, he rid the land of false idols and priests and set out on a new covenant with God. In American history, Josiah Bartlett was a statesman and a physician who signed the Declaration of Independence. On the TV series The West Wing, Josiah “Jed” Bartlett was the name of the president, played by Martin Sheen. |
| Isaiah | salvation of God; the Lord helps me | Hebrew | \i-saiah\ | A major prophet in the Bible, Isaiah manages to sound both old-school and cool, thanks to the combination of powerful vowel sounds. His prophecies targeted social injustices and predicted the coming of the Messiah. Allen Iverson and Elizabeth Hasselbeck are among the celebrity parents who have given their sons the name Isaiah, helping to keep it in the top 50. |
| Joshua | Jehovah is salvation | Hebrew | \j(o)-shua\ | For 25 years, Joshua was a top 10 boys' name in the US. Like Jacob, Josiah and Jeremiah, Joshua is a winning biblical name that starts with the later J. As the chosen successor to Moses, Joshua leads the Israelites into the Promised Land and to victory at the Battle of Jericho. There is an undeniable hunk factor with Penny Dreadful actor Joshua Hartnett and Sweet Home Alabama star Josh Lucas. Katherine Heigl and Josh Kelley named their son Joshua Bishop in 2016. James Van Der Beek had a son Joshua in 2012. NBA player Tony Parker named his son simply Josh. |
| Elias | the Lord is my God | Hebrew | \e-lias\ | Elias is softer and more muted than many fire-and-brimstone biblical names. There’s no thunder because Elias is one letter away from Elian and two letters away from the gentlemanly Ellis. Elias uses the nickname Eli, just as Elijah does. After 115 years, Elias has made it to the top 100 boys' names, but make no mistake: He’s on his way up. |
| Nathan | God has given | Hebrew | \n(a)-than\ | Nathan is a biblical name that's very popular in Europe, especially France. Parents can find inspiration in American Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale or the outspoken biblical prophet Nathan during the reigns of King David and King Solomon. Nathan has been in the top 50 boys' names since 1975 and frequently in the top 20 or 30. |
| Caleb | faith, devotion, whole hearted | Hebrew | \c(a)-leb\ | Caleb is a biblical name and a vintage name that has been in the top 50 since 1996. In the Old Testament, Caleb is among the followers who leave Egypt with Moses. Along with Joshua, he is rewarded for his devotion and lives long enough to see the Promised Land. Like the name Calvin, Caleb shares the appealing nickname Cal. Another nickname, Cale, is sometimes used on its own. Kaleb is an alternative spelling. Julianne Moore, Bill Murray, Jack Nicholson, Jonathan Jackson and Bo Bice are among the celebrity parents with sons named Caleb. |
| Eli | high | Hebrew | \e-li\ | Once considered a short form of Elijah, Eli is now recognized as an individual name in its own right. Famous namesakes include Super Bowl winner Eli Manning and inventor Eli Whitney. High-profile parents with sons named Eli include Twilight author Stephenie Meyer, actor Jeffrey Tambor, comedian Rachel Dratch, actor Coby Bell and journalist Campbell Brown. Country artist Jack Ingram has a daughter named Eli. |
| Aaron | mountain of strength | Hebrew | \a(a)-ron\ | Aaron has a steadfast and enduring quality. In the Bible he is the brother of Moses and Miriam and the Israelites' first high priest. Variant spellings include Aaryn, Aron (Elvis Presley’s middle name), Arun and Arran. The name Aaron can also be found in literary works by Shakespeare, George Eliot and James Fenimore Cooper. American statesman Aaron Burr famously killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin and NFL star quarterback Aaron Rodgers are among the modern-day achievers named Aaron. |
| Ezekiel | strength of God | Hebrew | \e-ze-kiel\ | If you’d like to give your son a biblical name with an important meaning, Ezekiel (“strength of God”) could be what you’re looking for. Considered one of the greatest prophets of his time, Ezekiel wrote the Old Testament book bearing his name and was among the captives taken to Babylon during the first fall of Jerusalem. Today his name is particularly popular with Jewish parents. Despite its deeply religious connotation, the name is sometimes shortened to Zeke, which has the personality of a cool surfer dude. |
| Jordan | down-flowing | Hebrew | \j(o)-rdan, jor-dan\ | The River Jordan is the name of a holy river in the Bible that the Israelites crossed to reach the Promised Land. It is also the site of Jesus’s baptism by John the Baptist. The name received a huge boost in popularity from basketball great Michael Jordan. It is truly a unisex name, although it’s used more for boys than girls. Dierks Bentley and Taylor Hanson are among the celebrity dads who have given this name to their children. |
| Hannah | He (God) has favored me | Hebrew | \ha(n)-nah\ | A popular Hebrew name, Hannah represents the pleasing elements of divine favor and grace. Breathier than its Latin counterpart Anna, Hannah was a top 10 name in the Social Security Administration rankings from 1995 to 2007. Hannahs dominate pop culture. Hannah Montana was Miley Cyrus’s pop-star alter ego on the Disney Channel show of the same name. Hannah was the writer and actress Lena Dunham’s thinly veiled alter ego on the HBO series Girls. Hanna was also the titular protagonist in a 2011 fairy-tale thriller starring Saoirse Ronan. |
| Jonathan | gift of God | Hebrew | \j(o)-na-than\ | For decades, Jonathan was ranked in the top 20 or 30 boys' names. It is a safe and straightforward choice for parents. Jonathan appears at least 15 times in the Bible. The best mention is for the bromance between Jonathan, a skilled archer and the eldest son of King Saul, and the future king David. Novelist Jonathan Safran Foer and talk show host Jon Stewart are both namesakes with plenty to say. Nontraditional spellings of this name include Jonathon, Johnathon, Jonathyn and Johnathan. |
| Axel | father is peace | Hebrew | \ax-xel\ | Axel as a boy's name is pronounced AX-el. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Axel is "father is peace". |
| Jeremiah | the Lord exalts | Hebrew | \j(e)-re-miah\ | This biblical name was embraced by the Puritans, who brought it to the New World in the 16th century. In the Old Testament, Jeremiah is a major prophet who warned of the fall of Jerusalem and spoke against the worship of false gods and idolatry during the reign of the last kings of Judah. In recent years, Jeremiah’s vintage, vowel-packed ending has made the name an old-school standout among parents, pushing it past the more contemporary Jerome and Jeremy. |
| Leah | delicate or weary | Hebrew | \leah\ | A favorite of 16th-century Puritans, Leah has been a top girls' name since 2008. In the Bible, Leah was Rachel’s older sister and Jacob’s first wife. The mother of Dinah and six of Jacob’s sons counts Moses, David, John the Baptist, Mary and Jesus among her descendants. Variations include Lea, Lia and the "Star Wars" version, Leia. Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk named their daughter Lea de Seine in 2017. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has a daughter Leah, as do reality stars Kate and Jon Gosselin. "Teen Mom 2" star Leah Messer Calvert has a daughter named Aleeah Grace. |
| Naomi | pleasant | Hebrew | \na(o)-mi\ | This biblical name has long been a favorite in Jewish families—and was loved by 17th-century Puritans too—but is more popular than ever, moving toward the top 100 girls' names since 1989. In the Old Testament, Naomi was the wise mother-in-law of Ruth who decides to call herself Mara after losing her husband and sons. In French, the name takes a twist and becomes Noemie, while in Italian it’s Noemi. |
| Eliana | God has answered | Hebrew | \e-lia-na\ | Eliana as a girl's name is of Hebrew origin meaning "God has answered". It may also be related to the Greek "elios" meaning "god of the sun", and the name may thus mean "daughter of the sun".  |
| Genesis | origin or birth | Hebrew | \ge-ne-sis\ | Genesis is an apt biblical choice for parents looking to make a new beginning or who want to honor a child at the start of her life. The first book in the Bible, Genesis tells the story of creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and Noah’s ark. It also details the lives of the four great patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph. Genesis started climbing the popuarlity ladder in the mid-1980s. |
| Jace |  | Hebrew | \j(a)-ce\ | Some nicknames develop a life of their own, with Jace representing an edgy, monosyllabic variant of the name Jason and a smoother counterpart to the name Chase. Director Jason DaSilva chose Jase for his son. Catchy and swift off the tongue and on the page, Jace has also made several appearances in fantasy fiction, including the trading-card game Magic the Gathering and the Mortal Instruments series. Jase Dyer was also a tragic love interest and gangster on the British soap opera EastEnders. There’s also Jace (Jason) Robinson of the reality TV trucking show Duck Dynasty. |
| Adam | son of red earth | Hebrew | \a-dam\ | In the Old Testament, Adam is the first man created by God out of clay. The name draws meaning from "adama," the Hebrew word for “earth.” On the TV show "Girls," viewers got a double dose of Adam: Hannah’s on-and-off boyfriend Adam Sackler was played by Adam Driver. And bringing even more fame to the name is Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine. |
| Micah | who resembles God? | Hebrew | \m(i)-cah\ | Micah is a variation of Michael that appears numerous times in the Bible. The most memorable of these is with Micah of Moresheth, a minor prophet and contemporary of Isaiah who predicts the fall of Jerusalem, the return of the people to the house of the Lord and the coming of the Messiah. While Micah has become more popular, it's not quite as mainstream as its counterpart Michael. Instead, it is seen as a fresh alternative—and one that can also be used for girls. |
| Aaliyah | rising | Hebrew | \a(a)-li-yah\ | Aaliyah is a variation of the name Aliyah, which means “rising” in Hebrew and “exalted or lofty” in Arabic. Other variations include Alia, Aleah, Aleia, Alya and Aliyya. (The latter is sometimes considered the feminine form of Ali, one of the 99 names of Allah in Islam.) Aaliyah is the most popular and preferred spelling of this name—and indelibly connected to hip-hop singer Aaliyah, who died in a plane crash in 2001 at age 22. |
| Madelyn | woman from Magdala | Hebrew | \m(a)-del-yn, mad(e)-lyn\ | This variation of the classic Madeline gets an update with a Y to join a league of –lyn names: Carolyn, Jaclyn, Roslyn and Gwendolyn. Can you think of more names where you could replace an –ine with a –yn? You might be surprised to hear that Madelyn is not a new innovation. According to Social Security data, the name has been around since at least 1900—and even more alternative spellings have cropped up on the popularity lists since then: Madilyn, Madelynn, Madilynn, Madalyn and Madalynn. |
| Anna | He (God) has favored me | Hebrew | \a(n)-na\ | Anna has been universally embraced by parents around the world. Russia, Sweden, Norway and Italy are just a few of the countries where Anna is beloved. It’s more distinctive than Ann or Anne and more formal than the nickname Annie. It also blends and pairs easily with other names. Without the letter H, Anna looks like her more popular sister Hannah. Anna has been the name of empresses and queens, as well as actresses such as Pitch Perfect star Anna Kendrick and True Blood actress Anna Paquin. To be even more different, some parents are opting for the Russian nickname Anya. |
| Delilah | languishing, lovelorn, or seductive | Hebrew | \d(e)-li-lah\ | Delilah as a girl's name is of Hebrew origin meaning "languishing, lovelorn, or seductive". It is the Biblical name of the woman who beguiled Samson into revealing the secret of his superhuman strength. |
| Gabriella | heroine of God | Hebrew | \gab-riella, gabri(el)-la\ | Gabriella is the Italian feminine form of Gabriel. Today it is more popular than the French form Gabrielle or the Spanish form Gabriela. All three share the nicknames Gabby, Gabi and Gabbie. According to Social Security data, Gabriella has been in the top 200 names since 2000. Actress Gaby Hoffman is a real-life Gabriella. The name took center stage in "High School Musical" with leading lady Gabriella, played by Vanessa Hutchens. Reality TV star Teresa Giudice has a daughter named Gabriella. Alec and Hilaria Baldwin used Gabriela as a middle name for their daughter, Carmen. |
| Sadie | princess | Hebrew | \s(a)-die\ | Sadie is a vintage name that has been in use as a properly independent name since the 19th century. Originally Sadie was a nickname for Sarah. Today its cheery upturned ending makes it sought after and fashionable. It remains a standout among vintage names like Millie and Maddie. Occasionally, Sadie is used as a pet form of Mercedes. Sadie is popular with the celebrity parent set. Christina Applegate, Adam Sandler, Jesse Williams and Cynthia Watros all have Sadies at home. |
| Amir | prince; treetop | Hebrew | \a-mir\ | An accent mark makes all the difference in the meaning of Amir. Put an accent over the “I” and it translates to “prince”; put a mark over the “a” and it means “prosperous.” The name is popular in the US among people of Middle Eastern descent as well as Arabs and Muslims in non-English-speaking countries. The name first found itself on the name charts in 1976, shortly after repeal of a law that limited non-European immigration to the US. Besides being a fast-climbing name, Amir is also an offshoot of a title (emir) given to high-ranking Muslim officials. |
| Jason | healer; the Lord is salvation | Hebrew | \j(a)-son\ | In Greek mythology, Jason led the Argonauts to sail in search of the Golden Fleece. (And along the way, he fell in love with a sorceress.) But in the New Testament, Jason is the name of one who showed hospitality to St. Paul. Though it never reached No. 1, Jason was a top 5 name from 1973 to 1982. According to Social Security data, it fell out of the top 50 in 2004 but remains solidly in the top 100. It helped pave the way for the popularity of Jacob and even Mason. Jayson is an alternative spelling that’s in the top 500.  |
| Sarah | princess | Hebrew | \s(a)-rah\ | What’s remarkable about the name Sarah is how enduring and timeless it is. In the Bible, Sarai is the beautiful but barren wife of Abraham. At age 90, God changes her name from Sarai (“she who strives”) to the noble Sarah (“princess”) and blesses her with a child. She gives birth to Jacob and becomes the matriarch of the Jewish people. Sarah was in the top 50 girls' names from 1979 to 2001 but has since declined in popularity. |
| Josephine | Jehovah increases | Hebrew | \j(o)-sephi-ne, jos(e)-phine\ | Add “ine” to the Hebrew name Joseph (“God will increase”) and you’ve got the French female version, Josephine. It hit its stride in the popularity polls, claiming the top spot, just before and after 1900. During that time period the book “Little Women” was published; it featured Josephine March, a character who shortened her name to "Jo," reflecting the character’s bold and brave spirit. |
| Elliott | the Lord is my God | Hebrew | \e-llio-tt\ | Elliot lags slightly behind the two-“t” version in terms of popularity. It’s a Greek name derived from the Hebrew name Elijah. In the Bible, Elijah was a prophet who was chosen by God to persuade the Israelites to worship one God (Yahweh) and reject the pagan cults. The name translates into “Yahweh is God.” In modern times, Elliott has been a popular boys' name for over 100 years. Though it has never achieved the fame that Elijah has, it’s finding new recognition as a girls' name. “Good Morning America" host George Stephanopoulos named his older daughter Elliott in 2002. |
| Samantha | God heard | Hebrew | \s(a)-man-tha, sam(a)-ntha\ | An American classic, Samantha has strength and spunk, thanks to sporty nicknames like Sam and Sammy. It was at the peak of its popularity in the 1990s and firmly in the top 10 on the Social Security Administration rankings from 1988 to 2006. It has long been considered the female version of the name Samuel, and some parents are turning to just Sam for their daughters, as Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards did. Notable Samanthas on TV include talk show host and comedian Samantha Bee, the tomboyish and tough Sam on iCarly and the confident Samantha Jones on Sex and the City. |
| Nathaniel | God has given | Hebrew | \n(a)-tha-niel\ | Nathaniel is the English form of the New Testament name Nathanael, with elements found in both Nathan and Daniel. It was used in 17th-century England and brought to the US by settlers. It remains a traditional and beloved favorite and offers the appealing nicknames Nat and Nate. Also a popular name in literature, Nathaniel can be found in the works of Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Ayn Rand.  |
| Eva | life or animal | Hebrew | \e-va\ | Three high-profile actresses have brought this name back to the spotlight: Eva Green, Eva Longoria and Eva Mendes. Eva, the Latin form of Eve, looks like a heady combination of Ava and Eve. It's also a timeless nickname for Evangeline. Three-letter names are super short and super popular, from Ada to Ava and Gia to Mia. Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo named one of his twins Eva, and Brandon Jenner has a daughter named Eva James. |
| Jonah | dove | Hebrew | \j(o)-nah\ | Jonah as a boy's name is pronounced JOE-nah. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Jonah is "dove".  |
| Elliot | The Lord is my God | Hebrew | \el-ee-it\ | Elliot is a gender neutral name of a somewhat mixed origin. This name, though originally derived from biblical Hebrew notions, it now serves readily as a secular name, too. Popularized in Scotland as well, this name has made its rounds about the world and we think it's perfect for baby who's bound to do the same. |
| Madeline | woman from Magdala | Hebrew | \m(a)-deli-ne, mad(e)-line\ | Feminine and graceful, Madeline possesses ancient roots that can be traced to Magdala, the hometown of Mary Magdalene. The French version Madeleine carries an extra E that makes it look more sophisticated; it's also the name of a delicious cookie inspired by a young girl. And the classic children's book heroine Madeline is a schoolgirl who uses the Anglo spelling but lives in Paris. Both Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State, and children’s author Madeleine L’Engle spell their names the French way. |
| Zachary | the Lord recalled | Hebrew | \z(a)-cha-ry\ | Although it may start with the last letter of the alphabet, Zachary sports some nicknames that push it to the front of the line: Zach, Zack and Zak. A Biblical name and a presidential name, Zachary hails from the Greek name Zacharias in the New Testament and the Hebrew name Zechariah. A top 50 contender from 1989 to 2003, Zachary is now in the top 150. (Zackary comes in at a distant second.) Elton John, Elizabeth Vargas and Cheryl Tiegs are among the celebrity parents with sons named Zachary. |
| Brielle | heroine of God | Hebrew | \b-rielle, bri(el)-le\ | Brielle is a girl's name meaning "heroine of God" that comes from the Hebrew name Gabrielle.  |
| Zion | highest point | Hebrew | \zion\ | Pronounced ZYE-on, this is a unisex name of Hebrew origin that’s mostly chosen for boys. A zion was a citadel that was in the center of Jerusalem, which explains why it means “highest point.” Today it’s known as the biblical term for the Promised Land; Zionism refers to the movement to establish a Jewish homeland. To Rastafarians, a religious group in Jamaica, the name means "utopia." When singer Lauryn Hill and Rohan Marley, son of reggae superstar Bob Marley, called their son Zion in 1997, the name became an instant hit. Chicago Bulls player Dwayne Wade also called his baby boy Zion in 2007. |
| Adriel | of God's flock | Hebrew | \a-driel, ad-riel\ | Adriel as a boy's name is pronounced AY-dree-el. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Adriel is "of God's flock". Biblical name. |
| Eden | place of pleasure | Hebrew | \e-den\ | Eden as a girl's name is of Hebrew origin meaning "place of pleasure". Eden is the name of God's garden paradise for Adam and Eve in the Bible. |
| Jayce | healer or the Lord is salvation | Hebrew | \ja(y)-ce\ | Jayce as a boy's name is of English, Greek, and Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Jayce is "healer or the Lord is salvation".  |
| Emmanuel | God is with us | Hebrew | \e-mma-nuel\ | Emmanuel as a boy's name is pronounced ee-MAN-yoo-el. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Emmanuel is "God is with us". Biblical: a name-title applied to the Messiah, Jesus.  |
| Malachi | messenger of God | Hebrew | \m(a)-la-chi\ | This boys' name honors one of the Hebrew prophets who wrote the final book of the Old Testament (the Book of Malachi) and was said to have predicted the coming of Christ. Pronounced MAL-a-kye, the name is a particular favorite in English, Gaelic and Hebrew-speaking countries. In Ireland, St. Malachy of the Roman Catholic Church was the first Irishman to be declared a saint. The name still has a strong hold: In 2016, the lead role of Kunta Kinte in a TV revival of “Roots” was played by the English actor Malachi Kirby. |
| Eliza | God is satisfaction | Hebrew | \e-li-za\ | Even if you’re not a musical theater fan, you’ve likely heard of Eliza Doolittle from “My Fair Lady." Or maybe you know it because of “Bring It On” actress Eliza Dushku. Either way, it’s a name worth remembering. This abbreviated form of Elizabeth (from the Hebrew Elisheva, or "God is satisfaction") dates to the 16th century; 200 years later, it stood on its own as a first name. Tracing it to the name of Hungarian and Portuguese saints has given Eliza even more popularity. |
| Jesus | the Lord is salvation | Hebrew | \j(e)-sus\ | A popular name for boys in Spanish-speaking households, Jesus speaks directly to a family’s devotion and faith. While there are many saints’ names and appellations to honor—Maria, Lourdes, Concepcion and Pilar are but a few—for boys, there are only Jesus and Messiah. Peaking in the early 2000s, Jesus is on the decline in popularity. |
| Isabelle | God's promise | Hebrew | \i-sa-belle, isab(el)-le\ | Isabelle as a girl's name is related to the Hebrew names Elizabeth and Isabel. The meaning of Isabelle is "God's promise". |
| Matteo | gift of God | Hebrew | \m(at)-teo\ | The Italian version of Matthew has become super popular—and not just in Italian-American communities but across the US. While it’s not nearly as beloved as Mateo with one “t,” which is in the Top 100, Matteo has come a long way and has a lot going for it: It’s strong and masculine, full of Italian flavor, and comes with a cool nickname, Teo. Singer Ricky Martin named one of his twins Matteo in 2008, and as did Colin Firth for his son in 2003. |
| Judah | praised | Hebrew | \j(u)-dah\ | In the Old Testament, Judah was the fourth of Jacob’s 12 sons and known as the ancestor of one of the tribes of Israel. Also, Judah Maccabee was a Jewish priest and a warrior who famously led a revolt against the Seleucid Empire. With roots in Hebrew, it has been a favorite biblical name since the late 1990s and is still appealing today. Judah Friedlander of “30 Rock” is a famous namesake. |
| Abel | breath, vapour | Hebrew | \a-bel\ | Abel as a boy's name is pronounced AY-bel. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Abel is "breath, vapour". |
| Ayla | deer or gazelle | Hebrew | \a(y)-la\ | Pronounced AY-lah, the name comes from the boys' name Elah. It has a charming, feminine connotation (thanks to its meaning “deer” or “gazelle”) and the “la” suffix. Ayla came on the American radar in the late 1980s, after “The Clan of the Cave Bear” movie featured a character named Ayla. There are a lot of similar-sounding names with one-letter differences, such as Kayla, Layla and Jayla, but if you want to stick to the basics, go with Ayla. |
| Ariel | lion of God | Hebrew | \a-riel\ | Ariel as a girl's name (also used as boy's name Ariel), is pronounced AYR-ee-ul. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Ariel is "lion of God". |
| Jesse | the Lord exists | Hebrew | \j(es)-se\ | Jesse as a boy's name (also used as girl's name Jesse), is pronounced JESS-ee. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Jesse is "the Lord exists". Biblical: the shepherd father of King David.  |
| Abraham | father of a multitude | Hebrew | \a-bra-ham, ab-raham\ | Since he’s considered the founder of the Jewish people, it’s no wonder Abraham's name means “father of a multitude.” According to the Old Testament, God made a pact with Abraham to give him a “multitude of descendants,” which is how he became the father of Isaac when he was 100 and his wife, Sarah, was 90. Need more proof that Abraham is an awesome name? Think about the legacy of Abraham Lincoln who abolished slavery during his presidency. Both men were powerful, tenacious and smart—traits any parent would be eager to see in a son. |
| Joel | Jehovah is the Lord | Hebrew | \joel\ | Joel as a boy's name is pronounced JOH-ul. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Joel is "Jehovah is the Lord". Biblical: a prophet and writer of the Book of Joel. |
| Ariella | lion of God | Hebrew | \a-riella, ari(el)-la\ | You may think Disney invented the name Ariel—where this spelling variation, Ariella, comes from—but it goes way back to biblical times. While Disney popularized the name, Ariel, by giving it to 'The Little Mermaid’s' princess in the 1989 movie, the Old Testament mentions it as a synonym for Jerusalem, with the translation of “lion of God,” or hero. Ariella is an especially feminine form of the unisex Ariel with its frilly “ella” suffix. Ariella couldn’t be more girly girly: It’s like a beautiful flower opening up its petals to the sun. |
| Matias | gift of God | Hebrew | \m(a)-tias\ | Matias as a boy's name is of German, Greek, and Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Matias is "gift of God".  |
| Kaleb | dog; tenacious, aggressive | Hebrew | \k(a)-leb\ | Kaleb as a boy's name is pronounced KAY-leb. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Kaleb is "dog; tenacious and aggressive".  |
| Jordyn | down-flowing | Hebrew | \j(o)-rd-yn, jor-dyn\ | Jordyn, as a name for boys or girls, has Hebrew origins, and the meaning of Jordyn is "down-flowing". Is related to the name Jordan. |
| Israel | God perseveres | Hebrew | \i-srael, is-rael\ | The ancient and modern states of Israel were named after this Hebrew Bible character whose name was taken from the Hebrew Yisrael, meaning “God perseveres, contends.” When Jacob was in his 90s, God changed his name to Israel for his perseverance. He is considered the father of the kingdom of Israel. Though it’s traditionally a boys' name, leave it to “Girls” star Jemima Kirke to rock the cradle and name her daughter Rafaella Israel when she was born in 2010. |
| Aliyah | rising, ascending | Hebrew | \a-li-yah\ | Aliyah is both a name and a concept. It comes from the Arabic name “Ali,” which means “rising" or "ascending.” As a name, it’s a version of “Aaliyah” and is pronounced ah-LEE-ya; as a concept it refers to the immigration of Jews to Israel. While it’s on the charts, a different spelling, Aaliyah, is preferred by American parents, which is how the pop singer Aaliyah Haughton (who went by just her first name professionally) spelled her name. |
| Simon | to hear, to be heard; reputation | Hebrew | \s(i)-mon\ | Simon is one of those names with a biblical background that doesn’t sound ancient in modern times. In the New Testament, Simon—a form of the Hebrew name Simeon—was an apostle (known as Simon Peter). Though the name has been used in English-speaking countries for centuries, it has a British feel. One of the most famous men with the name is Simon Cowell, the tell-it-like-it-is English judge on “The X Factor.” |
| Zane | God is gracious | Hebrew | \z(a)-ne\ | Maybe it’s because the “Z” is in your face or because it has an appealing one-syllable simplicity. Whatever the reason, you’ll always notice Zane and his bros Zain and Zayn. Thanks to author Zane Grey, who made cowboy lit fly off the shelves in the early 20th century, “Zane” became huge in the US. Guys with this masculine name also tend to have an independent streak, as proved by Zayn Malik, who left the British boy band One Direction in 2015 to start a solo career. |
| Ruth | friend or companion | Hebrew | \r(u)-th\ | Ruth may not have the same cool factor as other old-fashioned baby names, like Emma and Isabella, but it has something equally great: deep biblical ties that make it trend-proof. The Book of Ruth in the Hebrew Bible is one of only two books named after a woman (the other is Esther). If you’re looking for a modern-day role model named Ruth, look no further than Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the few women in history to hold that position. |
| Annabelle | favored grace | Hebrew | \a-nna-belle, annab(el)-le\ | The three-syllable combination of Anna and Belle is a winning, feminine choice. You get twice the number of cool nicknames—Annie, Anna, Belle, Bella—and also have a distinctive and feminine name that flows easily and gracefully. Not all combination names are quite so harmonious. Spellings include Annabel, popular in 12th-century Scotland, and Annabell, with two Ns and two Ls joining the two As. Amabel is a more obscure variation, meaning “lovable.” |
| Rachel | ewe or female sheep | Hebrew | \r(a)-chel\ | In the Bible, Rachel was the beloved, beautiful wife of Jacob (who met her when she tended sheep, thus “ewe” being the Hebrew name’s meaning) and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, who became two of the twelve tribes of Israel. Though the name was once common among Jewish people in the Middle Ages, it gained favor in Christian communities after the Reformation in the early 16th century. It has been popular among parents of many ethnic groups ever since. There are many celebrities named Rachel—McAdams, Weisz and Maddow, to name a few—not to mention Rachel Greene, played by Jennifer Aniston in the TV series "Friends." |
| Daniela | God is my Judge | Hebrew | \d(a)-nie-la\ | This name is the feminine version of Daniel, which comes from “daniyel,” meaning “God is my judge.” Thanks to the rapidly increasing Hispanic population in the US, Daniela has pushed up the baby-naming charts consistently since first appearing in the early 1970s. It’s more popular with American parents than Danielle, the French version, and Daniella, the English form. |
| Tobias | God is good | Hebrew | \t(o)-bias\ | Tobias as a boy's name is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Tobias is "God is good".  |
| Lilah | languishing, lovelorn, seductive; night beauty | Hebrew | \l(i)-lah\ | If you like the name Lila but want to give it a little more oomph, go ahead and add an H to the end. Or maybe you were set to name your baby Delilah but realized it was just too trendy for your taste. Why not chop off the first two letters and create something more unusual? Whatever your reasoning, you’re left with Lilah, a fresh, stylish name that would delight any little girl to have. You can pronounce it LYE-lah or the more exotic LEE-lah. |
| Josue | Jehovah increases or Jehovah is salvation | Hebrew | \j(o)-sue\ | It’s a tricky one to say correctly, but here’s the phonetic version: hAW-suu-eh. In Hebrew, Josue—the Spanish version of Joshua—means “Jehovah increases; Jehovah is salvation.” In the Hebrew Bible, Joshua was an important figure as he succeeded Moses as the leader of the children of Israel and showed them the way into the promised land. Josue made it on the US naming charts in the early 1970s and has been getting more popular ever since. |
| Cohen | null | Hebrew | null | Cohen is a baby name of Hebrew origin. |
| Rebecca | to bind | Hebrew | \r(e)-bec-ca, reb(e)-cca\ | One of the most important women in the Bible, Rebecca means “to bind" or "to snare” in Hebrew, a fitting description since she tricked her elderly husband, Isaac, into choosing their younger son, Jacob, and not their older son, Esau, to lead the future tribes of Israel. Besides being smart, she was considered beautiful and dynamic. Though it has always been a common Jewish name, Americans didn’t begin calling their daughters by this baby name until the 1600s, when the Puritans introduced it to the US; it was particularly popular during the 1970s. It’s the name of the happy/not happy mom on the much-watched TV drama “This Is Us.” |
| Jane | God is gracious | Hebrew | \j(a)-ne\ | For parents seeking a simple and spectacular name, look no further than Jane. Yeah, yeah, we’ve heard about plain Jane, Jane Doe and other Jane references that put it in a less-than-bright light. But what about novelist Jane Austen, anthropologist Jane Goodall and actress Jane Lynch—just a few real-life Janes who’ve achieved great success and made the name one of the most recognizable since the 16th century. Fluff-free and feisty, Jane, meaning “God is gracious,” is as classic as name can get. |
| Miriam | wished for child | Hebrew | \m(i)-riam\ | If trendy names don’t interest you, Miriam could be just what you’re looking for. It’s a historical Hebrew name and the oldest-known version of Mary. In the Bible, Miriam was a heroine who, as the sister of Moses, cleverly saved his life when he was a baby by hiding him in a basket among the rushes at the river's edge for the Pharaoh's daughter to find. Another clever female with that name is actress Miriam Shor, who plays the feisty Diana on “Younger.” |
| Amira | princess; treetop, proverb, or sheaf of corn | Hebrew | \a-mi-ra\ | The smart and sultry Amira sounds like it could be the name of a Disney princess! In fact, “amira” means “princess” in Arabic (Hey, Disney, you listening?). This pretty name is a favorite in the Middle East and South Asia, whether it's spelled Amira, Ameera or Amyra. The name also has Hebrew roots and is the feminine form of Amir. It's often given to girls born on Shavuot, the Jewish holiday celebrating the wheat harvest and ripening of the first fruits. |
| Shiloh | His gift | Hebrew | \sh(i)-loh\ | Shiloh as a girl's name is of Hebrew origin meaning "His gift". Shiloh is also the site of a crucial battle in the American Civil War. |
| Annie | He (God) has favored me | Hebrew | \a(n)-nie\ | If you’re into names that are casual but solid, Annie is your girl. It used to be considered an endearing nickname for the more formal Anne, but today Annie stands on its own as a legit name to put on a birth certificate. And if you believe, like the plucky little redhead of musical fame, that “the sun will come out tomorrow,” bet your bottom dollar that your daughter will inherit your optimism. Bonus points if you have a dog named Sandy. |
| Leia | child of Heaven; Heavenly flowers | Hebrew | \leia\ | Leia as a girl's name has Hawaiian origins. The meaning of Leia is "child of Heaven; Heavenly flowers". Is related to the name Leah. |
| Joaquin | established by God | Hebrew | \jo(a)-quin\ | Pronounced wah-KEEN, this name has color and mystery rolled into one exotic package. First brought to the attention of many US parents by actor Joaquin Phoenix and talk show host Kelly Ripa, who gave the name to her son, it’s the Spanish version of Joachim, a biblical name. Joaquin is also a saint considered the Virgin Mary's father. Even if people sometimes mispronounce it, Joaquin still makes a great choice if you want a sophisticated alternative to José or Juan. |
| Gideon | feller of trees; powerful warrior | Hebrew | \gi-deon\ | If you’re looking for a boys' name from the Bible, you’ll want to make this one a contender. God asked Gideon to save the Jews from the Midianites. The name has a heroic connotation, and parents are attracted to it, because who doesn’t want their son to be a hero (even just in their minds)? As far as its rank compared with other biblical names, like Jacob and David, it’s not one you hear as often, which makes it a bit distinct. |
| Madilyn | woman from Magdala | Hebrew | \m(a)-dil-yn, mad(i)-lyn\ | This unusual spelling of Madeline is phonetically easier to say—there’s no question the last syllable is “lin,” not “line,” as the original name implies. As with the myriad versions of this name, Madilyn is tied to Mary Magdalene, a special follower of Jesus who, according to the New Testament, was the first person he appeared to after the resurrection. Magdalene, which is Latin, became Madeliene in France, then Madeline in England, then this Americanized version popular in the 1990s. |
| Makayla | who resembles God? | Hebrew | \m(a)-kay-la\ | Makayla as a girl's name has Hebrew origins. The meaning of Makayla is "who resembles God?". Is related to the name Michaela. |
| Michelle | who resembles God | Hebrew | \m(i)-chelle, mich(el)-le\ | There’s no Michelle more well-known than former first lady Michelle Obama. In fact, her popularity has helped keep the name on the charts, though if parents want a feminine form of Michael, they’re more likely to go with Michaela. Michelle is the anglicized version of the French Michele, and it means “who resembles God,” so it has a strong religious link. Michelle first took off in the 1940s and was reinvigorated when the Beatles released a love song of the same name in 1965. |
| Talia | heaven's dew or lamb | Hebrew | \t(a)-lia\ | Sylvester Stallone’s “Rocky” blew up American movie screens in 1976. A year later, the name Talia—a name that’s at least 400 years old—landed on the baby-name charts for the first time. That may very well be attributed to actress Talia Shire, Stallone’s costar. (She was the Adrienne of “Yo, Adrienne!” fame.) Pronounced TAL-ya, it’s a simple and lovely name to give your baby girl. Its origins are likely Hebrew, but it could also be a shortened version of the elegant Russian name Natalia. |
| Izabella | God's promise | Hebrew | \i-za-bella, izab(el)-la\ | This Polish and Hungarian version of Isabella first caught the eye of American parents near the turn of the century. But in terms of popularity, Isabella is a top girls' name in the US, far ahead of her sister name Izabella. Both names come from the same stock, which is the Latin form of Isabel (which is the Spanish version of Elisabeth). |
| Ismael | God listens | Hebrew | \i-smael, is-mael\ | Latino parents interested in a name with biblical ties found it in Ismael, the Spanish spelling of Ishmael. According to the Old Testament, Ishmael was a son of Abraham and forefather of the Arab people. It was made even more famous thanks to Herman Melville’s 1851 novel, 'Moby Dick', which features a character with the name. |
| Arielle | lion of God | Hebrew | \a-rielle, ari(el)-le\ | Unlike many baby-name variations, which don’t add much to the changed name, this respelling fleshes out Ariel into a more feminine alternative. That “–elle” ending—so popular with names like Isabelle and Gabrielle—takes a winning turn here too. Though Ariel is way ahead of Arielle in popularity, the latter has shown it’s a worthy member of the sisterhood. The original name gained prominence when the title character from “The Little Mermaid” was named Ariel, in 1989. |
| Gabrielle | heroine of God | Hebrew | \gab-rielle, gabri(el)-le\ | If Gabriel is the hero of God, then the French feminine version of the name, Gabrielle, is the heroine. Though the name has been around for centuries, it only became popular with American parents in the last half of the 20th century, especially in the late 1990s. Today, it’s still a chosen name but less so than the Italian version, Gabriella. It’s a stylish name, evidenced by the fact that it belonged to fashion icon Coco Chanel, even if she didn’t use it. Proud bearers of the name include pro volleyball player Gabrielle Reece and actress Gabrielle Union. |
| Ezequiel | strength of God | Hebrew | \e-ze-quiel\ | Ezequiel as a boy's name is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Ezequiel is "strength of God".  |
| Jared | descending | Hebrew | \j(a)-red\ | Jared is the kind of name that sounds like it was invented in modern times yet goes back a long ways (according to the Hebrew Bible, Jared was a close descendant of Adam). The name has an edge to it and no celebrity embodies edgy (and quirky) better than actor Jared Leto. After an on-and-off relationship with the baby-name charts for decades, Jared became super-trendy in the 1980s and '90s. |
| Nehemiah | comforter | Hebrew | \ne-hemiah, nehe-miah\ | This biblical boys' name refers to the leader of the Jews who rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem once the city was returned from Babylonian rule; he also got the people back in touch with their faith. Nehemiah, mostly considered a Jewish name, was barely recognized until almost the 21st century when it and lesser-known biblical names like Zachariah and Josiah became popular. |
| Elle | sun ray | Hebrew | \e(l)-le\ | Elle Woods from 'Legally Blonde' put a bubbly, you-go-girl spin on this simple name, which soared in popularity when the movie came out in 2001. Elle earns extra points because it has a chic French connection: “Elle” is the pronoun “she” in French. If you want to get in on the “el” and “elle” craze (Ella, Isabelle) but prefer a name that hasn’t exploded yet, choose Elle. It’s worked quite nicely for actress Elle Fanning and model Elle Macpherson.  |
| Jaiden | thankful or God will judge | Hebrew | \ja(i)-den\ | Move over Jayden and Jaden, there’s another member of your tribe who ranks on the baby name charts. It’s Jaiden, a unisex name that, just like the other two, means “thankful, God will judge.” American parents dreamed it up in the 1990s, and even though they use it for boys and girls, it’s more dude than dainty. The name is likely based on Jadon. |
| Johnny | God is gracious | Hebrew | \jo(hn)-ny\ | For a town as trendy and in love with all that’s young and new, Hollywood has a lot of entertainers with this old-fashioned nickname, which is now a legitimate given name. There’s film king Johnny Depp and Johnny Galecki of “The Big Bang Theory.” Then there’s reality TV star Johnny Knoxville and Olympic figure skater/TV commentator Johnny Weir. The name has a familiar, chummy feel to it and a meaning that’s Oscar worthy: “God is gracious,” from the Hebrew version of John (which is the real first or middle name of all the Johnnys above). |
| Elianna | God has answered | Hebrew | \e-lianna, eli(an)-na\ | Elianna as a girl's name is related to the Hebrew name Eliana. The meaning of Elianna is "God has answered".  |
| Madeleine | woman from Magdala | Hebrew | \m(a)-delei-ne, mad(e)-leine\ | Say "oui" to this French version of the English name Madeline, which itself came from the Latin Magdalene (derived from Magdala, home of Mary Magdalene from the New Testament). Madeleine (pronounced MAD-a-lin or MAD-a-lean) ranks as third most popular spelling, after Madeline and Madelyn, and has been on the name charts since the 19th century. As with many things with a French spin, Madeleine has more charm and sophistication than the other spellings. |
| Zayne | God is gracious | Hebrew | \za(y)-ne\ | Zayne as a boy's name is related to the Hebrew name Zane. The meaning of Zayne is "God is gracious".  |
| Jessica | He sees | Hebrew | \j(e)-ssi-ca\ | Jessica Alba, Jessica Chastain, Jessica Biel: There’s no shortage of Jessicas who’ve distinguished themselves in entertainment today. But the name goes way back: In 1596, William Shakespeare presumably coined the name, basing it on Iscah, a biblical name spelled Jescha in his day, and used it for Shylock’s daughter in “The Merchant of Venice.” The Hebrew name Yiskah means “clairvoyance.” A favorite in the US for more than 100 years, it dominated the naming charts in the 1980 and '90s and is still well-loved. |
| Salem | peace | Hebrew | \s(a)-lem\ | Salem as a boy's name is pronounced SAY-lem. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Salem is "peace".  |
| Daniella | God is my Judge | Hebrew | \d(a)-niella, dani(el)-la\ | You know how crazy-popular Ella and Stella are with parents today? In the 1980s and '90s, that was Daniella. And she’s still kicking. If you’re looking for a pretty name that has a trendy element ("–ella”) but veers off in a nontrendy direction, Daniella nails it. It even comes with a cute nickname, Dani. As with the boy’s name that it’s derived from, Daniella has a deep religious connection to the Bible, including the Book of Daniel. |
| Jamie | he who supplants | Hebrew | \j(a)-mie\ | This is the kind of name that fits either a boy or girl rather nicely. It’s relaxed, friendly and doesn’t put on any airs. It comes from James, which is Hebrew, but the nickname Jamie was actually a 19th century Scottish invention. The name was a big hit with both genders in the 1970s. Actor Jamie Foxx wears his name well, as does actress/reality show star Jamie Chung. |
| Solomon | peace | Hebrew | \s(o)-lo-mon\ | Choose this name if you’re looking for one with a biblical background. In the Old Testament, Solomon, the son of David and Bathsheba, succeeded his father as king of Israel and was revered for his wisdom. Derived from the Hebrew “shalom,” meaning “peace,” Solomon has always been an important name to the Jewish community, and after a decline in popularity in the 20th century, it's now finding its way back on the baby name charts. |
| Selah | boulder or cliff | Hebrew | \s(e)-lah\ | Selah as a boy's name is of Hebrew origin meaning "boulder or cliff".  |
| Emanuel | God is with us | Hebrew | \e-ma-nuel\ | Emanuel feels religious, historic and dignified all at once. It also feels as if it’s misspelled. Isn’t it supposed to have a double M, as Emmanuel does? It actually depends on where you’re standing. In Germany, Croatia and other European countries, the single-M variation is the preferred spelling. It has also caught on with US parents who like the idea of changing things up. A famous single-M bearer: French fashion designer Emanuel Ungaro.   |
| Noa | movement | Hebrew | \noa\ | Noa as a girl's name is of Hebrew origin meaning "movement". |
| Johnathan | gift of God | Hebrew | \jo(h)-na-than\ | Can’t decide between John and Jonathan? Combine them! That first H sticks out, but maybe that’s the point. Expect your son to do some explaining when spelling his name out loud (“It’s Jonathan with an H after the ‘jo.’”)—it’s that unusual—but here’s something positive: Your boy will distinguish himself from the Jonathans of the world with that extra letter, as proved by Johnathan Joseph, the Houston Texans cornerback. |
| Mathias | gift of God | Hebrew | \m(a)-thias\ | Mathias as a boy's name is of German, Greek, and Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Mathias is "gift of God".  |
| Azariah | helped by God | Hebrew | \a-za-riah\ | Azariah as a boy's name is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Azariah is "helped by God". From Azarel.  |
| Seth | set, appointed | Hebrew | \s(e)-th\ | Most people have heard of Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam and Eve. But did you know there was a third son? According to Genesis, his name was Seth and he was born in Adam’s likeness and image. It was a known name in England during the Middle Ages but really took off after the Protestant Reformation in the 17th century. The name is simple, straightforward and biblical. Seth is the given name of Hollywood funnymen Rogan and MacFarlane, and we're not joking when we say, maybe baby will be just as funny. |
| Danielle | God is my Judge | Hebrew | \d(a)-nielle, dani(el)-le\ | Although Danielle is clearly the French feminine version of Daniel (the suffix “–elle” is the giveaway), American parents have taken the name as their own. It debuted on the baby-name charts in the 1930s and hit its highest ranking from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. It’s still an elegant, European-flavored name that’s got a high likability factor thanks to Danielle Johnson of “Orange Is the New Black” and Danielle Panabaker of “The Flash.” |
| Uriel | angel of light; flame of God | Hebrew | \u-riel\ | Uriel as a boy's name is pronounced OOR-ee-el. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Uriel is "angel of light; flame of God".  |
| Jamison | he who supplants or son of James | Hebrew | \j(a)-mi-son\ | Jamison as a boy's name is of Hebrew and Old English origin, and the meaning of Jamison is "he who supplants or son of James". |
| Sarai | princess | Hebrew | \s(a)-rai\ | Sarai as a girl's name is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Sarai is "princess". Sarai is related to the name Sarah. |
